# Welcome to Blaise design system react components

React component implementations of the [ONS Design system components](https://ons-design-system.netlify.app).

## Viewing the documentation

There is a GitHub action that on merge to `main`, will build the new documentation and push to this URL in GitHub pages.

For viewing them locally you can run:

```bash
yarn run storybook
```

Which will start the documentation to auto reload on changes, running on `localhost:6006`.

## Creating documentation

You can build component documentation by creating a new `.stories.tsx` file.

First we import the component into a default statement, the title is where in the documentation the story will be,
so below the panel will be under the label `Components`.
You can also add a sub folder by adding a extra layer in the / for example `'Components/Error Boundary/Panel'`,
creates a `Error Boundary` group.
```tsx
export default {
    component: ONSPanel,
    title: 'Components/Panel'
} as Meta;
```

Create the standard template, which passes any arguments to the component. Then create a story so different type of the component,
like below you have a Info, Success and Error variant of the Panel component
```tsx
//ðŸ‘‡ We create a "template" of how args map to rendering
const Template: ComponentStory<typeof ONSPanel> = (args) => <ONSPanel {...args}/>;

//ðŸ‘‡ Each story then reuses that template
export const Info = Template.bind({});
export const Success = Template.bind({});
export const Error = Template.bind({});
```

Then for each variant of the component, pass in default arguments that you want the variant to have, like below the
different status's are passed into each variant

```tsx
Info.args = {
    children: <p>Some message in a panel</p>
};

Success.args = {
    status: "success",
    bigIcon: true,
    children: <div><h1>Title in a panel</h1><p>And then some text</p></div>
};


Error.args = {
    status: "error",
    children: <p>Some message in a panel</p>
};
```

## Add additional information to the Docs section

Storybook is clever and will pull in any standard JSDocs from your files into the docs tab for each component.
For example you can set a component description by adding a doc tag above the component.

```tsx
/**
 * This is a Standard Panel with an error status, with a prepared message.
 */
function ONSErrorPanel(): ReactElement {
```

You can also add more info to component properties as well

```tsx
export interface Props {
    /**
     * Render any standard HTML (or other React components) within the panel
     */
    children: any,
    status?: "success" | "error" | "info" | "warn",
    spacious?: boolean,
    id?: string,
    hidden?: boolean,
    testID?: string
    /**
     * Uses a bigger tick icon for the success panel only.
     */
    bigIcon?: boolean
}
```
